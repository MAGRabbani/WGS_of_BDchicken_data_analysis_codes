# WGS_of_BDchicken_data_analysis_codes
In this repository, I described all standard bioinformatic tools/codes run in the Scientific Linux 7-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) system used for the analysis of WGS data from 96 Bangladeshi indigenous chickens. We used BGI's DNBSEQ-T7 next-generation sequencing technology for paired-end 150bp short reads sequences.
